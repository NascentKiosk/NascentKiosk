###  Hi there, I'm Timothy 🖐👊
I've done remote work for agencies, worked for comapnies, and collaborated with talented people to create digital products for both business and consumer use. I'm quietly confident, naturally curious, and I try to leave every bit of code I touch more readable, modular and accessible than I found it.
